# GitWorks: AI-Powered GitHub Repository Reviewer âœ¨

GitWorks is a Python script designed to run in Google Colab that automatically reviews GitHub repositories based on a predefined set of guidelines. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to analyze the repository's content and structure, providing feedback formatted as a potential GitHub Issue.

This tool is particularly useful for assessing project maturity, ensuring adherence to coding standards, or checking compliance with specific MLOps practices.

## Features

* **Automated Repository Analysis:** Fetches and concatenates the content of files in a specified GitHub repository.
* **AI-Powered Review:** Uses Google Gemini to analyze the code and structure against user-provided guidelines.
* **Customizable Guidelines:** Comes with a built-in MLOps checklist (Prototype, Alpha, Beta, GA levels), but you can easily modify the `guidelines` variable in the script to fit your own standards.
* **Configurable:** Easily change the target repository, Gemini model parameters (model, temperature, max tokens), and output options.
* **GitHub Issue Creation:** Optionally creates a new issue in the target repository containing the review title and body generated by Gemini.
* **Colab Integration:** Designed for easy setup and execution within a Google Colab environment, utilizing Colab Secrets for secure credential management.

## How it Works

1.  **Setup:** You provide a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and a Gemini API Key, stored securely in Colab Secrets.
2.  **Configuration:** You specify the target GitHub repository (`owner/repo`) and configure Gemini model parameters.
3.  **Content Fetching:** The script uses the GitHub API (via `PyGithub`) to recursively fetch the content of all files in the target repository's default branch.
4.  **Content Aggregation:** The content of all text files is combined into a single string, formatted with file path indicators.
5.  **AI Analysis:** The aggregated content, along with the predefined `guidelines` and instructions, is sent to the specified Gemini model. The AI is instructed to perform a review and structure its response as a GitHub issue (title and body).
6.  **Output:** The generated review (title and body) is displayed in the Colab output.
7.  **Issue Creation (Optional):** If `CREATE_ISSUE` is set to `True`, the script uses the GitHub API to create a new issue in the target repository with the AI-generated title and body.

## Usage

1.  Open the script (`.ipynb` file) in Google Colab.
2.  Complete the [Setup](#setup) steps to configure your secrets.
3.  Navigate to the **CONFIGS** section in the script.
    * Set the `REPOSITORY` variable to the target repository you want to analyze (e.g., `"your-username/your-repo"`).
    * Adjust `MODEL`, `TEMPERATURE`, and `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` as needed for the Gemini AI.
    * Set `CREATE_ISSUE` to `True` if you want the script to automatically create an issue in the target repository, or `False` to only display the review in the Colab output.
4.  **(Optional)** Modify the `guidelines` string variable under **CONTENTS** > **Guidelines** if you want to use custom review criteria.
5.  Run all cells in the notebook (`Runtime` > `Run all`).
6.  Observe the output in the **ANALYSIS** > **Review** section.
7.  If `CREATE_ISSUE` was `True`, check the "Issues" tab of the target repository for the newly created review issue.

## Configuration Parameters

* **`MODEL`**: The Gemini model to use for the analysis (e.g., `"gemini-1.5-flash"`).
* **`TEMPERATURE`**: Controls the randomness of the AI's output. `0.0` makes the output more deterministic. Higher values (e.g., `0.7`) increase creativity.
* **`MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`**: The maximum number of tokens the AI should generate for the review.
* **`REPOSITORY`**: The target GitHub repository in `"owner/repo"` format.
* **`CREATE_ISSUE`**: A boolean (`True`/`False`) determining whether to create a GitHub issue with the review results.

## Guidelines

The script includes a multi-level MLOps checklist within the `guidelines` variable. The current levels are:

* Level 1: Prototype
* Level 2: Alpha
* Level 3: Beta
* Level 4: GA (General Availability)

You can edit the `guidelines` string directly in the script to define any set of rules or checks relevant to your project or organization.
